## Abstract of Paper
  This paper looks into whether reviews alone can be used to predict Best Picture Winners throughout history. Utilizing machine learning models, namely Decision Trees,  with different amounts of features (all relating to reviews and opinion), this paper compares accuracy metrics to make conclusions on the effect of reviews on a movie's chances of receiving Best Picture. Additionally, this paper also looks at the factor of competition, using calculated features to conclude whether the reviews of the other movies in a given year have an impact on a movie's success at the Oscars.
